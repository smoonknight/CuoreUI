# ![cui logo mini](https://i.imgur.com/8fLdRDY.png) CuoreUI.Winforms

This is a C# .NET Winforms library with **modern** controls, components and forms.

## 🗿 Why use Cuore

**UI Design**

CuoreUI draws inspiration from web UI designs. Tries to support control animations, blur effects on controls, and rounded forms for a "modern" look.

**Lightweight**
*(Data from Early July 2025)*

While smaller in size than other competitors, it still packs similar features due to not being obfuscated and not having a license manager.

**Cautious with Resources**

We dispose classes inheriting `IDisposable`, and use memory efficiently.
